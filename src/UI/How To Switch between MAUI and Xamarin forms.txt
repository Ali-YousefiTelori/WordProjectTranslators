How To Switch between MAUI and Xamarin forms

For MAUI Only replace:

xmlns="http://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms"
to
xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/dotnet/2021/maui"


For Xamarin Forms Only replace:

xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/dotnet/2021/maui"
to

Note:
Replace these only in Shared Project that have pages, not another.
